# universal user indicator

## metadata

standard: extension

## description

used to mention a specific user on a specific platform, when the person represented by the user is either unknown or uses different usernames in different places

this is *not* intended to be used to refer to a user on the *same* platform as their reference, use the platform's preferred notation for that

## syntax

`[site name abbreviation]/u/[username]` or `[site name abbreviation]/@[username]`, depending on how much you like reddit

usernames containing spaces should be quoted, not bracketed (parens and other brackets are significantly more likely to appear in a username than quotes)
