# natlang extensions

switching to a conlang is hard: first you have to learn it,
then you have to convince everyone else you talk to to learn it too!

however, minor extensions to existing languages are much easier
to learn/use/integrate, so really, why *not* use them?

## repo structure

all files should have a path conforming to this schema:
`(repo root)/[language name]/[extension name].md`.
PRs that don't follow the schema will be adjusted until they do.
(you'll still be credited under [contributors](#contributors),
but i'll probably be labeled as the committer in the log)

`[language name]` should be written in english, but `[extension name]`
should be written in the language it extends, as should its
contents. all file names should be written in lowercase, with
underscores as the word separator (eg `Word Separation` ->
`word_separation`).

## organisation/social

### discord

https://discord.gg/DAuUSrr3yz

within there, hop over to #linguistics (i'll make a channel specifically for this project whenever it becomes neccessary)

### irc

both channels are unregisterd on libera.chat, so just /join them directly instead of going through any client features
- ##natlang-extensions - specifically for this, if you don't like discord (i can't blame you, irc is quite nice)
- ##hexa6 - more general chat for all the things i've started
